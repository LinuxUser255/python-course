# When to Use Name Guarding in OOP

## When to Use Name Guarding (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)

1. **In Reusable Modules**
   - When your file contains classes or functions that might be imported elsewhere
   - When the file serves dual purposes as both a library and a standalone script

2. **In Testing Scenarios**
   - When you include test code or examples in the same file as your class definitions
   - When you want to demonstrate usage without forcing execution upon import

3. **In Framework Development**
   - When building components that might be used in different contexts
   - When creating utilities that can be both imported and run directly

4. **In Educational Code**
   - When writing example code that demonstrates concepts but might also be imported
   - When creating tutorials where code might be reused in different contexts

## When NOT to Use Name Guarding

1. **In Pure Script Files**
   - When the file is meant to be run directly and never imported
   - When writing simple, one-off scripts with no reusable components

2. **In Entry Point Files**
   - In files specifically designated as application entry points
   - In "main.py" or similar files whose sole purpose is to start the application

3. **In Configuration Files**
   - In files that only contain configuration settings or constants
   - In files with no executable code beyond variable assignments

4. **In Some Framework-Specific Files**
   - In files where the framework handles execution context (e.g., some web frameworks)
   - When the framework documentation explicitly recommends against it

## Best Practice Guidelines

- **Default to Using It**: When in doubt, include name guarding
- **Consider Future Use**: Even if you don't plan to import the file now, future requirements might change
- **Consistency**: Follow the conventions of your project or team
- **Documentation**: If your approach differs from project standards, document why

In OOP specifically, name guarding is particularly valuable because classes are designed for reuse, and separating definition from execution is a core principle of good object-oriented design.
